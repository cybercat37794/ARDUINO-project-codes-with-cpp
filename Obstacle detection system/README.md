# Obstacle Detection System using ARDUINO

# Introduction
Choosing a microcontroller is how easy it is to develop products around it. Key
considerations include the availability of an assembler, a debugger, a code-efficient C
language compiler, an emulator, technical support, and both in-house and outside expertise.
We have chosen Arduino series because a lot of community support is available online. Many
free and efficient code samples from different projects are present for Arduino.

# Components
1. Arduino IDE (any version)
2. Arduino Uno (R3) board
3. Sonar Sensor (HCSR04)
4. LED
