# Traffic Light Control System Using ARDUINO

# Introduction
Arduino is an open-source platform used for creating interactive electronics projects. Arduino
consists of both a programmable microcontroller and a piece of software, or IDE (Integrated
Development Environment) that runs on your computer, used to write and upload computer
code to the microcontroller board. Arduino Uno also doesnâ€Ÿt need a hardware circuit
(programmer/ burner) to load a new code into the board. We can easily load a code into the
board just using a USB cable and the Arduino IDE (that uses an easier version of C++ to
write a code).
