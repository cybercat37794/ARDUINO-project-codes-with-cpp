# Decade Counter System Using ARDUINO
# Introduction
The objective of this experiment is to interface a 7 segment display with Arduino Uno.
# Components
1. Arduino Uno R3
2. Arduino IDE (any version) 
3. 7 segment display (HDSP5503)
# Basis of a 7 segment display
A seven segment display consists of 7 LEDs/ segments all arranged in the shape of the digit
“8”. Most of the segment display has 8 segments (with a dot at the right side of the digit
representing the decimal point. All of the seven segments are named by sequence from “A” 
letter to “G” and “DP” for the decimal point. And each of the segments can be controlled as
individually just like a regular LED.
